## Project: SunRez

**SunRez** is a desktop app designed for college residential staff to efficiently manage student housing services. It features a Graphical User Interface (GUI) but is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI).

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the CRUD for Issues
  * What it does: Allows users to track issues pertaining to the specified rooms.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because users would be aware of pending issues that need their attention along with having a history of issues that the rooms have so as to identify rooms that maybe prone to damages.

* **New Feature**: Added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&since=&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=stein414&tabRepo=AY2021S2-CS2103-T14-1%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false)
