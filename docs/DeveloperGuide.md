## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores the address book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object.<br>
![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

</div>


### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the address book data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.


### Room Features

The Room family of features consist of the following features: Add Room, Edit Room, List Rooms, Find Room and Delete Room. 

#### The Room Class
The Room class consists of 4 fields, each of which contain their own methods to verify their respective input. This allows for a low degree of coupling, and individual fields can change their input verification rules without affecting the other classes. Similarly, the Room class can expand to contain more fields without affecting existing fields too.

Examples of verification functions in each of the fields include `RoomNumber#isValidRoomNumber()`, `RoomType#isValidRoomType()`, etc.

![The Room Class](images/room/RoomClass.png)

The `Room` objects are stored in a `UniqueRoomList` which is held by `AddressBook`.  

##### Alternatives considered
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Abstract fields of Room out as separate classes
    * Pros:
        * Each field can take care of its own validation
        * Updating a field does not update the Room class itself
    * Cons:
        * More classes to manage and individually track
        * Might be unintuitive to initially understand
* **Alternative 2:** Leave fields of Room as member variables of the Room class
    * Pros:
        * Everything is self-contained within the Room class, single source of "truth"
    * Cons
        * Field verification becomes a responsibility of the Room class which is not desirable (Violation of SRP)
        * Changes to individual fields would impact the Room class which may unintentionally break other things
        * Less object oriented approach which goes against the principles of how this project was set up

#### Add Room
This section will detail the implementation of the Add Room feature via the `oadd` command,

##### Overview of Insertion Process 
The AddRoomCommand is triggered through the use of `oadd` followed by valid parameters such as room number, type, etc. The entire command string must then be parsed to extract the parameters that were inserted, and if they are all valid, a Room object is constructed and added to the model and saved to the backing store. Upon successful insertion, a feedback message is displayed to the user. 

This process is summarised in the diagram below
![Adding a Room](images/room/AddRoomCommandActivityDiagram.png)

##### AddRoomCommand
The `AddRoomCommand` inherits from the `Command` object and overrides the `execute()` method. It checks if the model already has the room being inserted, and if it does not, it will insert the room.

The inheritance from `Command` allows `Logic` to deal with and manipulate polymorphic `Command` objects without dealing with the specific implemetations of each `Command` object.

##### Detailed execution pathway
The diagram below details how the user's command to add a room propagates through the system to eventually add a room. 

![Adding a Room](images/room/AddRoomCommandSeqDiagram.png)

### Issue Features

The Issue family of features consist of the following features: Add Issue, Edit Issue, List Issue, Find Issue, Delete Issue and Close Issue.

#### The Issue Class

The Issue class consists of 5 fields, each of which contain their own methods to verify their respective input. This allows for a low degree of coupling, and individual fields can change their input verification rules without affecting the other classes. Similarly, the Issue class can expand to contain more fields without affecting existing fields too.

Examples of verification functions in each of the fields include `Category#isValidCategory()`, `Status#isValidStatus()`, etc.

![The Issue Class](images/Issue/IssueClass.png)

The `Issue` objects are stored in an `IssueList` which is held by `AddressBook`.

#### Add Issue

This section will detail the implementation of the Add Issue feature via the `iadd` command.

##### Overview of Insertion Process

The AddIssueCommand is triggered through the use of `iadd` followed by valid parameters such as room number, description, etc. The entire command string must then be parsed to extract the parameters that were inserted, and if they are all valid, an Issue object is constructed and added to the model and saved to the backing store. Upon successful insertion, a feedback message is displayed to the user.

This process is summarised in the diagram below
![Adding an Issue](images/issue/AddIssueCommandActivityDiagram.png)

##### AddIssueCommand

The `AddIssueCommand` inherits from the `Command` object and overrides the `execute()` method.

The inheritance from `Command` allows `Logic` to deal with and manipulate polymorphic `Command` objects without dealing with the specific implemetations of each `Command` object.

##### Detailed execution pathway
The diagram below details how the user's command to add an issue propagates through the system to eventually add an issue.

![Adding an Issue](images/issue/AddIssueCommandSeqDiagram.png)

### Command History Feature
The command history feature has a few sub-features:
1. View history command: the user can list the command history.
1. Navigate history: the user can navigate their command history like in a terminal program.
1. Save/load history: command history persists across SunRez runs.

This section starts with an overview of the command history model then looks at each sub-feature in turn.

#### Implementation

##### Command History Overview
SunRez command history is represented by a `CommandHistory`, stored in the `ModelManager`. A `CommandHistory` is 
composed of zero or more `CommandHistoryEntry` objects, each representing a previously entered command. New entries
can be appended to `CommandHistory`. `CommandHistory` implements the `ReadOnlyCommandHistory` interface, 
which provides a non-editable view of the implementing `CommandHistory`; this readonly view is used by other components
that do not need to append to the command history. For example, the view history command reads it to display it - or a 
filtered portion of it - to the user.

The following class diagram shows an overview of the command history subsystem and its relation to other components.

![CommandHistoryModelClassDiagram](images/commandhistory/CmdHistModelClassDiagram.png)

##### How Command History is Updated
`Logic#execute()` triggers the update. Only _after_ a command parses and executes successfully will that command's text 
be appended to the command history via `Model#appendCommandHistoryEntry()`. If either parsing or execution fails,
then `CommandHistory` will be unchanged. The following sequence diagram shows this process pictorially using the 
example command `help`.

![CommandHistoryUpdateSequenceDiagram](images/commandhistory/CmdHistUpdateSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: 
**Note:** In the sequence diagram above, `parseAndExecute()` is not an actual method; rather it is a simplification
of a two-step process in the Logic component. The important thing to note is that `CommandHistory` is updated only
_after_ a command is parsed and executed successfully by the Logic component.
</div>


##### View History
SunRez allows the user to list the full command history, or a portion of it, through the command `history [COUNT]` where
`[COUNT]` is an optional integer that the user can specify to limit the number of most-recent entries to be listed.
If `[COUNT]` is omitted, then the full command history is displayed.

Viewing command history is implemented through `ViewHistoryCommand` and supported by `ReadOnlyCommandHistory`. 
`ViewHistoryCommand#execute()` accesses command history through the view of a `ReadOnlyCommandHistory`, reads the 
entries it needs to display, formats the entries into a message, then finally returns the message wrapped in 
a `CommandResult`, to be displayed to the user. The following sequence diagram illustrates the main interactions
between `ViewHistoryCommand` and the Model component. It uses the example command of `history 5`. 

![ViewHistorySequenceDiagram](images/commandhistory/CmdHistViewHistorySequenceDiagram.png)

##### Navigate History
The user navigates their command history via the UP and DOWN arrow keys. The UP and DOWN arrow keys respectively 
select the previous and next commands in history, if any.

The UP and DOWN key press events are first handled by `CommandBox` in the UI component. `CommandBox` delegates the 
logic of navigation and keeping track of state (which command we are selecting) to a `CommandHistorySelector`.
The `CommandHistorySelector` is called via `#selectNext()` and `#selectPrevious()` which are expected
to respectively return the next and previous commands in history since they were last called. Upon receiving the 
relevant commands from `CommandHistorySelector`, `CommandBox` will populate its text box with that command's text.
The following sequence diagram shows the aforementioned relationships.

![AccessHistorySequenceDiagram](images/commandhistory/CmdHistAccessHistorySequenceDiagram.png)

`CommandHistorySelector#selectLast()` can also be called to reset the selection to the most recent command in history.
This is useful, for example, when a user has navigated to the middle of their command history then executes a new 
command. At this point, we want navigation to start from the most recent command again - not where the user was
before he/she executed a command.

Currently, SunRez uses a `SuppliedCommandHistorySelector` as its `CommandHistorySelector`. This implementation uses
a `Supplier<ReadOnlyCommandHistory>` to view SunRez command history whenever it is called to select a new entry.

##### Save/Load History
SunRez automatically saves command history after each command execution, and loads command history (if any) upon app 
start-up. The command history is saved in a plain-text file at `[JAR_file_location]/data/commandhistory.txt`. 

Saving and loading is supported by `CommandHistoryStorage`, an interface that exposes read and write methods. SunRez
currently uses an implementation of this interface called `PlainTextCommandHistoryStorage`, which serializes each
command history entry as a single line of plain text in the command history file. The class structure is shown 
in the class diagram in the _Command History Overview_ subsection above.

Command history is saved immediately after it is updated. `CommandHistoryStorage` creates a serialized string from
a `ReadOnlyCommandHistory` view of the command history, then writes it to disk using `FileUtil#writeToFile()` as a
helper. The following sequence diagram shows a simplified view of the storage process from command execution to 
writing the command history to file. For brevity, `FileUtil` is not shown, and the details of appending a command 
history entry are abbreviated to `appendCommandHistoryEntry("help")` because they are detailed in the subsection 
_How Command History is Updated_ above.

![CommandHistoryStorageSequenceDiagram](images/commandhistory/CmdHistStorageSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations

##### Aspect: Should history include invalid commands?

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only record valid commands (commands which parse and execute successfully).
    * Pros:
        * Less cluttered command history.
        * A User can still easily correct typos in a failed command because SunRez does not consume the input if it 
          fails to execute.
    * Cons: 
        * Behaves less like a regular shell program, so the user might be expecting different behavior.

* **Alternative 2:** Record all command text that the user tries to execute.
    * Pros:
        * Behaves more like a regular shell program.
    * Cons: 
        * More cluttered command history.
        * Arguably does not help the user correct typos in failed commands (see Alternative 1: Pros).

##### Aspect: Should command history selection logic be in `CommandBox`?

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** No, abstract it out to an interface `CommandHistorySelector` with a backing 
  implementation.
    * Pros:
        * Follows SRP because `CommandBox` is part of the UI component, but history selection is logic. If selection
        logic is left in `CommandBox`, then it now has two reasons (UI and logic) to change.
        * Easier to unit test because logic is separated from UI.
    * Cons:
        * More complex to implement: one additional interface and class.

* **Alternative 2:** Yes, keep the selection logic in `CommandBox`.
    * Pros:
        * Simpler to implement: no additional classes or interfaces; and the selection logic is quite straightforward,
          so the bloat may be acceptable in the short term.
        * Arguably, selection only affects the `CommandBox` so the added complexity may not be worth it.
    * Cons:
        * Harder to unit test because selection logic is bundled with UI.
        * Pollutes a UI component with details of logic. If we wish to change the selection logic in future but not
          the UI, `CommandBox` will still need to change.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

![CommitActivityDiagram](images/CommitActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

Nina works as a housing service management officer for a Residential College* (in NUS). She is the sole manager of the office. She:
* has to manage a large number of residents and rooms (> 600)
* needs to efficiently assign rooms to residents
* handles room allocation exercise every semester
* needs to track room issues reported by students during the semester
* needs to update the issue lifecycle (reported => maintenance ongoing => fixed/closed)
* prefers typing over interacting via GUI

**Value proposition**: manage residents, rooms, and allocations faster than a typical GUI app.
