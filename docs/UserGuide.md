## Quick start

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your SunRez.

4. Double-click the file to start the app. A GUI like the one pictured below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>

5. Type a command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

    * **`rlist`** : Lists all residents.

    * **`radd`**`n/Joseph Tan p/84666774 e/e0103994@u.nus.edu y/2` : Adds a resident named `Joseph Tan` with phone number `84666774`, email `e0103994@u.nus.edu`, a 2nd year student.

    * **`rdel`**`3` : Deletes the 3rd resident shown in the current resident list.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `d/DESCRIPTION [t/TIMESTAMP]` can be used as `d/Broken chair t/2020/3/23 11:59pm` or as `d/Broken chair`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `n/John Doe n/Jane Doe`, only `n/Jane Doe` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
