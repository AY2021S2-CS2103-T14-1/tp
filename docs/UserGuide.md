## Introduction
**SunRez** is a desktop app designed for college residential staff to efficiently manage student housing services. It 
features a Graphical User Interface (GUI) but is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI).

**SunRez** has the following features:
* Keeps track of maintenance issues
* Keeps track of student records
* Keeps track of room records

## About this Guide

### User Interface

### Command Format

Commands in this user guide follow this format:

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `radd n/NAME ...`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `radd n/John Doe ...`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `d/DESCRIPTION [t/TIMESTAMP]` can be used as `d/Broken chair t/2020/3/23 11:59pm` or as `d/Broken chair`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `n/John Doe n/Jane Doe`, only `n/Jane Doe` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `ilist`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

### SunRez Data Files

SunRez main application data and command history are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command
that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

#### Undo/redo history

Undo/redo history is not saved to the hard disk, so it will be lost when SunRez is exited.

#### Edit the data files

* SunRez main application data is saved as a JSON file `[JAR_file_location]/data/sunrez.json`.
* SunRez command history is saved as a plain-text file `[JAR_file_location]/data/commandhistory.txt`.
    * Each command history entry is a single line in the file.
    * The entire command history can be cleared by simply deleting the contents of the command history file.

Advanced users are welcome to edit these files directly.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">
**Caution**: <br>
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, SunRez will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.
